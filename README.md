# TypeTalk

A talk about the wonderful world of types and programming languages,
with a dash of formal verification. Does your programming language get
you down? It probably should! Ever wish you could prove that your
program was correct? Maybe you can! Join us as we briefly explore some
alternatives with typed functional programming languages. With a bit
of luck you will catch a glimpse into how programming languages can
make your lives easier, and the world a better and safer place. Types
aren't the Java-esk horrors of your nightmares, instead they can make
programming a pure delight! Let's discover why that annoying person
keeps talking about Haskell, and why that even more obnoxious person
won't shut up about Idris.
